This is a placeholder for an image showing the AWS Budget Alert setup process.

The image should show:
1. The AWS Billing Dashboard with "Budgets" selected in the left navigation
2. The "Create budget" button being clicked
3. The budget creation form with:
   - Budget name: "Bedrock-Monthly-Budget"
   - Budget amount: $30
   - Budget period: Monthly
   - Alert thresholds: 80% and 100%
   - Email notifications configured

This image would help users understand how to set up budget alerts manually if the automated script fails.
