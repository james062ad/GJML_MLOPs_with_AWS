This is a placeholder for an image showing the AWS CLI configuration process.

The image should show:
1. A terminal window with the `aws configure` command being executed
2. The prompts for:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region name (e.g., eu-west-2)
   - Default output format (json)
3. The successful completion of the configuration

This image would help users understand how to configure the AWS CLI manually if needed.
